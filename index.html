            <p id="summary">Hello! My name is Jack Morin and I am a soon to graduate Computer Science student at Rhodes College.<br>
                            My first exposure to Computer Science was taking a course on a whim my second semester of my Freshman year at rhodes<br>
                            Since that first class my desire to learn more about programming has only escalated.<br>
                            <br>
                            Aside from my interest in programming, I also enjoy Rowing with the Rhodes crew team as well as playing video games, especially fighting games like Guilty Gear and Tekken.<br>
                            I am a huge fan of prog rock with my favorite band being Yes. I love the sound of their music and will often have it playing whenever I am working.<br>
                            <br>
                            Memphis has been my home for my entire life and it has definetley had an impact on me. While I certainly will always have an attachement to Memphis; however, I am excited to look for opputunities in other cities as I continue my job search.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            ~~ Below I have listed some of the projects I have worked on throughout my time at Rhodes College, they include both personal and school projects. please feel free to click on them and read my more in-depth description about both the making and functionality of the projects
