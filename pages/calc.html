            I orginally sought out to make this project because my college's ciriculum offered nothing related to web based development. So, I wanted to start with a project that I viewed as something attainable having no prior knowledge of html/css/js
            I saw that many people have a calculator project as a begginner project and thats how I landed on starting this project.

            I initially sought out an html tutorial on YouTube as my way of familiarizing myself with html. At the time all I knew about web based development is that it used a core of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and i knew that html was the sort of skeleton of whatever I wanted to create.
            After watching many tutorials on HTML, CSS, and Javascript I decided to actually start developing the app. As it usually goes by only watching tutorials I realied that I had not retained as much information as I believed.
            It was only after going through documentation and actually working on my own project I felt that I start to grasp the use of these tools. Eventually through much trial and error I was able to get the application working.

            This project was very enjoyable to complete mainly due to it showing me how useful HTML/CSS/JS can be as well as just oening up a new avenue for projects.
            I also realized the ipmportance in actually doing the work to learn when trying to learn something on my own, and to not be worried about watching every tutorial I can before doing the actual work.
            Overall, this project was enjoyable and not too difficult once I understood how to use my tools.
