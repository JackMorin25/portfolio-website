            This was made as the final project in my intro to systems class in my junior year of college. It served to give us a basic understanding on how networks work.

            The bulk of the program was made following ideas from Beej's guide to networkig which proved to be an incredibly valuable resource. We established a connection between client servers and the main chat server through use of sockets. Since this chat server was run off of one prgram we used threads to have both the main server and client servers run at the same time to interact with each other.

            This program was very difficult to implement as that semester was my frist semester using C and my first time using threads. The project presented many difficulties but it felt very gratifying to eventually get the project to work.
