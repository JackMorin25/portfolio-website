            The goal of this group project was to find some database, use several datamining techniques and produce a resonible or interesting discovery from our data.
            This was the final project for my Data Mining class and I was able to learn a lot from it.

            My group focused on car crash data from specifically the chicago metropolitan area. Our original data set included many data points
            like crash time, car model, what type of injury occured, was there an injury at all, etc. This data had to be preprocessed as there was a lot of extranoious data.
            After processing the data we ran several data mining techniques such as naive bayes, k nearest neighbors, and made use of decision trees.

            In the end the data resulted in a spike in injury caused by car crash in late october around 3-4pm on a friday. Using data from a local weather station and looking at high school dismissal times,
            our group came to the sadly unsuprising result that highschool students rushing home on a friday in inclement weather cause more car crashes.
