             This program was a simple shell implementation made for my Intro to Systems class in college. It has limited commands but has the basic unix
              commands such as ls, cd, pwd, etc..

        <div id="box2">
            This was made using C and got parsed commands using calls to the system's library of commands. This project gave me 
             a lot of insight into the wokings of using the terminal and was pretty fun to work.

            This project was fun to work on and felt like it gave me a new depth of knowledge about the shell.
