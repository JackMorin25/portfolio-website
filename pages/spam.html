            This Project was made for my AI class in my junior year of college. We had been learning about naive bayes and this project was meant to be an implementation for naive bayes

        <div id="box2">
            This project was made in java using 2 main classes to differentiate the spam from the not spam. We were given a text file with words considered spam and another with words considered not spam. We used naive bayes to decide the weight on how likely these words were to be spam. After getting the weights you could the input a sentence even with words not given in the training data and figure out how likely the message was to be spam.

            This was a very enjoyable project to complete especially at the time because it did not feel too complex yet the reults were interesting and felt like it had real world applications.
