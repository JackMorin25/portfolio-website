            Another personal proejct in which I wanted to teach myself about webscraping as I have seen many people talk about it
            and wished to get a feel of it

            The project itslef was very simple in my opinion. It scrapes for stocks bought by politicians on a website which has this
             Information updated daily. My program scrapes the first 10 most recent stock exchanges and writes them to a csv file.

            I feel like i got a decent grasp on how to use a webscraper although I can tell that there is a lot more that these
             types of applications can do, and I will likely explore more projects related to webscraping.
